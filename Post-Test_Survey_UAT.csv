Sometimes I got a little bit impatient waiting for him to finish answering a question as he sends quite a few messages for some questions and sometimes the messages aren’t completely necessary. But I do like the way some of the messages bring about a sense of empathy, like “I’m sorry to hear you’re experiencing symptoms” etc. I found that Cory gave different answers to the same question depending on what I referred to the virus as, e.g to the question about “what are the symptoms” he gave a different answer when I used the word coronavirus, to COVID and an even different answer for COVID-19 (the best answer was when I used COVID, and he sent a photo of the symptoms and explained to get tested. I think it would be good if he gave the response for all of the possible variations of the virus name, since different people will refer to it in different ways. Overall it was a really great and pleasant experience, and I think Cory could help a lot of people! ",9,Post-Test,Exponential Growth
