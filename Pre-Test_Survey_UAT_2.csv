You are invited to take part in this study. Please read this Explanatory Statement in full before deciding whether or not to participate in this research. If you would like further information regarding any aspect of this project, you are encouraged to contact the researchers via the email addresses listed above.







What is the purpose of this research project? 

This project is meant to improve our understanding of how people will interact with a chatbot that is aimed at informing people about the disease COVID-19 and what they can do to make the best choices in light of the newest information available. In addition, we are interested in knowing which resources individuals are most likely to request from the chatbot, so we can improve the usefulness of the technology and optimize the user experience.

This project aims to identify the strengths and weaknesses of this technological aid in helping people understand the virus and its effects, as well as the current and future guidelines from the government. This will aid in improving people's knowledge on key factors of viral transmission and in making more informed decisions in their daily lives. 



Why were you chosen for this research?

This study is looking for healthy adults. To be included, you must meet the following criteria:


	Age between 18 and 35 years old
	Currently residing in Victoria
	You don't have any trouble reading for any reason (including uncorrected vision impairment)You have a phone, and a laptop with a webcam.

 

What does the research involve? 

First, you will complete an online intake questionnaire which asks you about your basic demographic data. Then, before the Testing session, we will ask about your attitudes regarding COVID-19 and your attitude towards government restrictions to limit the spread of COVID-19. The online questionnaire should take you less than 10 minutes. During the testing phase, you will be asked to interact with the chatbot for 30 minutes on your smartphone while being supervised by an experimenter via Zoom. In these 30 minutes, you will be asked to converse with the chatbot in order to get answers to specific questions in sequence. Afterwards, you will be asked to freely interact with Cory Covid-Bot for 30 minutes (without any supervision). Lastly, you will be asked to complete an exit survey (also online) wherein you provide feedback on your experience with Cory Covid-Bot and general questions about your attitudes on COVID-19 after accessing information on the subject.



Consenting to participate in the research
